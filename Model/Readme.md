## ðŸŒŸNOTE :-
<ul>
  <li>If pdf or ipython notebook will not load then please check markdown filde (.md)
  </li>
<li>I am not able to upload a large size model in github repo So you have to trained your model by yourself in your pc/laptop and Save as "plant_disease_model_1_latest.pt"</li>

<li> For flask we use this trained model </li>

<li> Make Sure if you change the model name then also changes required in flask app.py file </li></ul>
