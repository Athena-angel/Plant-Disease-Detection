# Model Architecture :

## NOTE :-

#### If pdf or ipython notebook will not load then please check markdown filde (.md)

#### I am not able to upload a large size model in github repo So you have to trained your model by yourself in your pc/laptop and Save it as "plant_disease_model_1_latest.pt"

#### For flask we use this trained model

#### Make Sure if you change the model name then also changes required in flask app.py file
